# An introduction to phitamine

## Overview

phitamine helps you to make PHP scripts with the programming language tré.
tré is a dialect of the Lisp family of programming languages which can be
transpiled to many other languages.  In case of PHP, tré brings its own data
types to bypass PHPs shortcomings.  So, phitamine comes to the rescue and
translates data from PHP and back.  You'll find easy access to request, form
and session data.  phitamine also brings you templates that make XML from Lisp
expressions, and a simple MySQL interface.


## How to use phitamine

First, make an empty directory that you can throw away easily just in case.
Then, unpack the phitamine archive.  You should get a directory of the same
name.  Then, make an own directory where you'll place your source codes and
symlink the phitamine directory into yours. Like:

    tar xvzf phitamine.tar.gz
    mkdir myproject
    cd myproject
    ln -s ../phitamine .

In your project directory, first set up a makefile that will compile your code
to PHP. Call it "make.lisp":

    ; A most simple makefile.
    (load "phitamine/make-project.lisp")
    (make-phitamine-project "Dummy project name"
                            '("toplevel.lisp"))
    (quit)

This makefile compiles some file called "toplevel.lisp", compiles it to PHP and
saves it as "index.php" into the directory "compiled" which it'll generate for
you if it's not already there,

Now for our toplevel script in which everything is supposed to start running:

    (phitamine)
    (princ "This works, too.")

phitamine doesn't output anything, except on run-time errors.  Please try to
compile this two-liner just to see if the version of phitamine you got is
working at all:

    tre make.lisp
    ...Helluvalot of compiler messages that finally tell
       you that everything is O.K. should occur here...
    php compiled/index.php

This makes the script we want and uses the command-line version of PHP to test
run it.  You should just get the message "This works, too.", so you can rock on
right away and try out your first template.


## Templates

Now, let's generate some HTML.  You could just print plain HTML, of course, but
in the world of Lisp, that'd make you miss some really neat features of the
language.  Instead, we assemble so-called LML expressions and have them
converted to HTML by phitamine.


### LML

In LML every list is a tag.  The first element must be a symbol for the tag
name.  A simple

    (hr)

will give you

    <hr/>

later on.  HTML5 has some tags that may not be closed at all, like the HR
element but I guarantee that browsers won't fail you on syntactically correct
XML. 

If you want attributes, use keyword symbols followed by values.  A keyword
symbol must never stand alone.

    (hr :class "dont_use_classes_too_often")

will give you

    <hr class="dont_use_classes_too_often"/>

But

    (hr :class)

will just break with an error message.  Inside an alement you can pack more
elements or just text nodes:

    (p "Go " (a :href "/" "home").)

will give you

    <p>Go <a href="/">home</a>.</p>

Should you need a tag with no contents but with an extra ending tag, like a
TEXTAREA element, use an empty string for the content:

    (textarea :name "message" "")

will give you the desired

    <textarea name="message"></textarea>


### Templates

Now for our first template: the index page of our little web site.  Make a
directory called "templates" where we'll put our LML files.  There, create a
file named "main.lisp" with the following content:

    (html
      (head "Our first page with phitamine")
      (body
        "Even this works."))

To get that template out, change "toplevel.lisp" to:

    (define-template tpl-main :path "templates/main.lisp")
    (phitamine)
    (princ (tpl-main))

The template TPL-MAIN will be available as a function that returns our HTML.
Compile the script again and better test it on your web server.  If you have
LAMP right under your fingers you may want to symlink the "compiled" directory
into your web space.  Most Linux installations have their web directory at
"/var/www".  It is so much more comfortable than working with cheap web space
you can only access via FTP.


### Template parameters

Parameters give templates their dynamic content.  They're passed to a template
function as an associative lists as the first argument.  Inside the template
use function PARAM to get a particular parameter.  The LML expressions are
backquoted automatically, so you must use the quasiquote to insert values:

    (html
      (head "Our first dynamic template")
      (body
        "Parameter X has the value &quot;" ,(param 'X) "&quot;."))

This is how "templates/main.lisp" should look like.  Also change
"toplevel.lisp" for the X parameter:

    (princ (tpl-main `((X . 42))))

Compile the script and run it in your browser.  You should get

    Parameter X has the value "42".


### Form data

Form and database records come as associative lists, too.  Our first, simple
form will show it. Here's the code we put in "templates/main.lisp" to replace
its old code:

    (html
      (head "Our first phitamine form")
      (body
        (form :method "post" :action ""
          (input :type "text" :name "email" :value ,(param-string 'email))
          (textarea :name "message" ,(param-string 'message))
          (input :type "submit" :value "Submit..."))))

In "toplevel.lisp" change the call of the template to

    (princ (tpl-main (form-data)))

That's it.  Whenever you post the form, it will return with its
former content.  phitamine also makes it easy to treat multiple posted records
or files, but more on this later.


## Actions

phitamine has a special mechanism to link parts of a request URL to handler
functions, called "actions".  We call the directory and file names "URL
components".


### Preparing actions

To be able to use components, we must configure Apache to NOT
throw an error message if a directory doesn't exist and to pass the URL to
our script.  To do that, create a ".htaccess" file next to your generated
"index.php" (assuming that the script is in the root directory of your
web server):

    Options -indexes
    RewriteEngine on
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
    RewriteRule .? index.php$1 [L]

If you placed the script in a subdirectory called "example", you must
change the last line to

    RewriteRule .? /example/index.php$1 [L]

Now, every time someone tries to open a page in the example directory, like
"http://whateveryourdomain.is/example/some_subdirectory", it will always invoke
your script and give it the component "some_subdirectory".
